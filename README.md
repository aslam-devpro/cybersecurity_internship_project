# 📚 My Cybersecurity Learning Projects

This repository contains two practical educational projects developed during my innternship at Elevate Labs focused on learning essential cybersecurity concepts and practices:

---

##  1. Secure Storage System(Project-5)

A simple and secure file storage system built with Python and PyQt5, designed to safely store files using AES-256-GCM encryption.

### 🔧 Key Features:

* Select a vault directory for encrypted file storage.
* Encrypt and decrypt files using a user-provided password.
* Simple graphical interface for easy interaction.
* Demonstrates secure key derivation using PBKDF2.

### 🎯 Learning Outcome:

Understand how encryption works in practice, the importance of secure key management, and file integrity principles.

##  2. SQL Injection Playground(Project-9)

An interactive web application built with Flask that demonstrates the dangers of SQL Injection (SQLi) and how to prevent them.

### 🔧 Key Features:

* Vulnerable login page showing unsafe string concatenation in SQL queries.
* Safe login page implementing parameterized queries.
* Simple Python-based SQLi detector that scans inputs for common injection patterns and logs attempts.
* Informative About page explaining the difference between unsafe and safe practices.

### 🎯 Learning Outcome:

Learn the mechanics of SQL Injection, how attackers exploit vulnerabilities, how parameterized queries prevent them, and the basics of attack detection and logging.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* Python (Flask, SQLite, Requests, PyQt5)
* Bootstrap for responsive frontend
* AES-256-GCM for file encryption
* Simple Python scripts for detection and educational demos
