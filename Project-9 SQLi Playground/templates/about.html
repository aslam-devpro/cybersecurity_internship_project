        <h2 class="mb-4">About SQLi Playground</h2>
        <p>
          This web app demonstrates how <strong>SQL Injection</strong> vulnerabilities work
          and how to prevent them using <strong>parameterized queries</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <hr>

        <h4>üî¥ Vulnerable Query Example</h4>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-light p-3 rounded">
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'"
        </pre>
        <p>
          Here, user input is directly concatenated into the SQL query.  
          Attackers can inject SQL code, for example:
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-light text-dark p-2 rounded">
Username: ' OR '1'='1' --
Password: anything
        </pre>
        <p>
          This bypasses login 
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">üü¢ Safe Query Example</h4>
        <pre class="bg-dark text-light p-3 rounded">
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=?"
cur.execute(query, (username, password))
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this version, user inputs are safely passed as parameters,  
          preventing malicious SQL code from executing.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4 class="mt-4">üõ°Ô∏è How the Detector Works</h4>
        <p>
          Along with demonstrating vulnerabilities, this playground also includes a 
          <strong>SQL Injection Detector</strong>.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The detector compares user inputs against a list of known malicious patterns, 
          such as common SQL injection keywords and operators.  
        </p>
        <p>
          - If suspicious input is found, it is flagged as a possible SQL injection attempt. <br>
          - Each attempt is logged with details and timestamps for analysis. <br>
          - If no match is found, the input is considered safe. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          This shows how detection systems can help identify malicious activity, 
          but also highlights that real-world systems use more advanced techniques than this simple educational demo.
